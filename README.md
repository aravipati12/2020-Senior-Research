# Developing an Automated Algorithm for Transcribing and Summarizing Videos


## Overview

### Motivation

* **Issue:** billions of gigabytes of videos produced daily
* **Audience:** everyday digital citizens
* **Need:** concise, accurate summaries
* **Purpose:** quickly gauging contentâ€™s value

### Proposed Solution

We will develop an algorithm to streamline and automate the process of **transcribing** and **summarizing** speech in TED talks using IBM Watson and natural language processing (NLP).

## Requirements

* IBM Watson
* FFMPEG
* Pydub
* Gensim

## Installation Instructions

* IBM Watson - Make an Account on https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-speech-to-text, Retrieve URL and API Key and Download Packages Using Homebrew
* FFMPEG - Download From https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html and Install Using Homebrew
* Pydub - Install Using Homebrew
* Gensim - Install Using Homebrew

## Run Instructions

Normally Run Python File in Terminal (ex. python3 stt.py)
