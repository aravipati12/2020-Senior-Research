I I'm a physicist and I think that the way we talk about physics needs a little bit of modification I am from the %HESITATION just on the radio to hear anymore but %HESITATION coming from around here it means I have a no the nana my mom's mom and not %HESITATION is very bright she hasn't had much formal education but she shop and I when I was a second year undergraduates studying physics at Cambridge I remember a %HESITATION spending an afternoon at nana's house in %HESITATION stunt studying quantum mechanics and I had this folder is open in front of me with this inner hieroglyphics let's be honest and %HESITATION not I came along and she looks at this folder and she said what stocks unless it is quantum mechanics nana I'm not I tried to explain something about this these what was on the page is to do with the the new cast an Einstein and because the ships and another looks very impressed and then said %HESITATION what can you do when you know that thirty nine I think it's something about computers but I guess it was all I could think of at the time you can fool not question out because it's a very good question what can you do when you know that when that is physics and I've come to realize that when we talk about physics inside here and also the image of it we don't include the things that we can do when we know that our perception of what physics is needs a bit of a shift I'm not an easy to miss a shift but this perspective sharing this different perspective masses for also cites the and I'm not just saying that because I'm a physicist not biased nothing with the most important people in the world honest your physics right we've got an image problem let's be honest and it hasn't moved on much from this this is a very famous post office from the soul of a conference in nineteen twenty seven and this is when the great lines of physics we're grappling with what it you know with the nature of determinism what it means are you to have a probability that posco might be somewhat whether any of it was real it was all very difficult so you'll notice that the role very stern looking men in suits %HESITATION Mari accurate keep noticing her hands were not market which would be a ton of the books I'm sorry Kerry said from the left on the bottom that she was allowed in but you have to dress like everybody else this is the this is this is this is yeah this is what physics not is always kind of hard to fix things up %HESITATION to do with waves and particles that is an artist's impression of two black holes colliding which makes it look worth watching to be honest I'm glad I didn't have to run the risk assessment whatever was going on that the point is this is the image of physics right it's weird and difficult it's done by study strange people dressed in a slightly strange way it's inaccessible it's somewhere else I'm the man to watch the cat the problem is not is not I'm a physicist I know this right I between the atmosphere on the ocean that was there is massive the Asian is massive the stimuli that joins them together is really important because that's where things go from one huge reservoir to the other you can see that the sea surface %HESITATION I was that was me took this video the average heights of those ways but I was ten meters so this is definitely the physics happening here there's lots of things this is definitely physics and it is not included in all cultural perception of physics not bulldoze me I'm so what is included in all cultural perception of physics well sorry %HESITATION because I'm a physicist has to a graph right that's allowed and so we've got time along the Boston hit from very small very fast things that's very long things take a long time it hit %HESITATION small things things that so all current cultural image of physics looks like this this quantum mechanics Donna not corner it's very small very wicked it happens very quickly and %HESITATION it's a long way down in the general you know on the scale of innocent masses for everyday life and it was because %HESITATION G. which is not bad very large very far away also very with it I'm and if you go to some places like black holes and making if you do those things to join up on the back and we know that these all frontiers in physics right there's lots of work being done to discover new physics in these places but the thing is you will notice is a very large gap in the middle and it got there are many things they're all planets in Tulsa volcanoes and clouds in car that some bubbles until things and also the things that make all every day life and these also run by physics you reason for there is physics in the middle it's just that nobody talks about set and the thing about all of these is that they will run on some the small number of physical laws things like Newton's laws of motion thermodynamics some rotational dynamics the physics in the middle of flies over huge range from very very small things to very very big things you have to try very hard to get outside of this and there is also a friend's hit research physics here it's just that we talked about it and this is the world of the complex when these laws work together they bring they bring about the beautiful messy complex world we live in a fundamental way this is the bit that really matters to me on an everyday basis and this is the bit that we don't talk about this plenty of physics research going on here but because it isn't doesn't involve pointing it starts people somehow some reason think it's not that now the cool thing about this is that the so many things in this middle path the this middle bit all following the same physical rules that we can see that his lord work almost all the time around the circle the video here so the game is one of these acts is a role on one of them has been boiled on what you tell me which ones which the diet which one's role the one on the left yes and even though you might have tried that you'll need and the reason for it is not are you certain spending that's alright and then when you stop there could check the one that's completely sold you stop the entire act when you stop the other one you only stop the shell liquid inside is still rotating because nothing's made it stop and it pushes the shell round again so that the excel story takes again I'm right it's a demonstration of something in physics that we called the law of conservation of angular momentum which basically says that he said something spinning about six dot says it will keep spending unless you do something to stop it and that's really fundamental %HESITATION and how the universe works and it's not just thanks for the replies to well there is really useful if you're the sort of person we'll do exist who will like them put them back in the fridge is not meant to it it's okay we were judging I'm sorry but it's also got much broader like about this is this is the Hubble Space Telescope the Hubble alternate failed which is a very tiny paws guy I'm hopeful has been floating in free space for twenty five years not touching and the things I need to complain to a tiny region of sky for the whole of daisies it didn't sections an accurate enough to take amazing images like this so the question is how does something that is not touching anything how does it know where it's and the answer is that in the middle of it it has something that's my great disappointment isn't soror AG but basically does the same job at this got gyroscopes which is spending a because of the law of conservation of angular momentum they keep spending but the same access %HESITATION indefinitely on Hubble kind of rotates around them and so it can orients itself so the same little physical lord but we can play with in the kitchen and use also explains some of the what makes possible some of the most advanced technology of all time and so you still think this is a fun physics to me is that you learn these toxins and then you can apply them again again again and it's really rewarding when you spot the menu places this is a fun physics I have shown not a video %HESITATION to a new use for the business people once they're all very dressed up are small and trying to employ that that trying to impress the bosses and and I run it was running out of time so showed the I. video and then so that we can work it out you can ask me afterwards to check a and I left the stage and then I had to the Midlands grown men talking on my sleeve afterwards saying this is it this and I said yes yes right the jewelry that you get from by these sporting these toxins doesn't go away when you're not old I'm not really important because physics is all about past sins and the small number of patents give you access to a pool almost all of the physics in our everyday world and the thing that's best about this is if all's playing with toys things like the I shouldn't be dismissed as the man day in little things that we just give the kids to play with on the sauce the afternoon to keep it quiet this is the stuff that she really is because this is the laws of the universe and applies to eggs and tastefully but the side down and also some of the things just as much as it applies to modern technology %HESITATION and anything else is going on in the world so I think we should play with these toxins so there are basically there a small number of concepts that you can become familiar with using things in your kitchen a really useful for life in the outside world he wants done I makes a duck is a good place to start for example %HESITATION wise I feature get cold once you go a bit so that I was with the don't you can also explain fridges and magnets %HESITATION that you comply with the new kitchen get you too it wouldn't turbines a modern energy generation and races in the night which is always a good things play with shorts a boring party fish some raisins out to the boss not put them in some laminate it's called three consequences first thing is is quite good to watch try it secondly it sends the boring people away food it brings the interesting people to you you went on all fronts and then those things you know spending gospels and discussed it with these little pot since the mail rights around as everyone on it's fundamentally democratic right everybody has access to the same physics you don't need a big push lock when I and when I read the book and I have the to the chapter on spin hundred about about tastefully but the side down and I gave the job to to you and a friend of mine who's no scientist and for him to read tell me what you thought and he took the %HESITATION took chapter why he was working overseas Michael this text message back from in a couple of weeks later and it said Dan I'm in breakfast in a posh hotel in Switzerland and I really want to push toast off the table because I don't believe what you write and that was a good but he doesn't have to he can push the taste of the table and try it for himself and see these little speeches two important things to know about science right this the fundamental laws that we have experts learned through experience experimentation work right the day which often apple and it goes up then we'll have a debate about gravity all up to that point we basically know how gravity works we can learn the framework and then the surprises of experimentation having confidence in things trying things out critical thinking how we move signs for it and you can then use of those things by playing with toys in the everyday world I'm and it's it's really important because you know this is all this talk about technology we've heard talks about quantum computing abilities to the mysterious faro things but fundamentally we still live in bodies they're about the size we still walk about selling chance are about the size we still live in the physical world unknowing being familiar with these concepts means we're not helpless and I think it's really important that we not helpless that society feels it can look at things because this isn't about knowing all the answers it's about having the frameworks you can ask the right questions and by playing with these fundamental things in everyday life we gain the confidence to ask the right questions so the biggest thing %HESITATION in on so it's not as question about what you can do when you know that causes a lot of the stuff in the everyday world that you can do when you know that specially people eggs in the fridge I'm and there's a much deeper answer I and this is all the fun and the curiosity that you could have playing with toys because we shouldn't by the way why should kids have been fun right all of this can have fun playing with toys we shouldn't be embarrassed about it you can blame me it's fine %HESITATION so you when it comes to reasons for studying physics for example here is the best reason I can think of I think that each of us has three life support systems we bought our own body we've got the planets and we'd go all civilization each of those is an independent life support system keeping us alive in its own way and they all run on this fundamental physical laws you can learn in the kitchen with eggs and two cups of lemonade and everything else you comply with say but this is the reason for example that something like climate change is such a serious problem it's because it's two of these life support systems all planets and %HESITATION civilization kind of busting up against each other they're in conflict and we need to negotiate that boundary on the fundamental physical laws that we can learn the all the way the world around us works under the two of the tools of the basis of everything now the foundation was lots of things no by life but knowing the foundations is going to get you a long long way I think this if you're not interested in having fun with physics or anything like that strange but anyway how do these people exist and you come you surely are interested in keeping yourself life right how all life support systems work because the framework for physics is remarkably constant right it's the same in most most of things that we measure it's not going to change any time soon they might discover some new quantum mechanics apples right here still gonna fall down so the question is how do you know yeah sometimes how do you stop was the place to start if you're interested in the physical world in not being helped us and in finding some toys to play with so you Hey it is my suggestion to you system things the thought was it stops right the place to start is that moment on adults do this right you you're drifting along someone and you spot something you bring those %HESITATION those wit and then you'll consciousness goes up you're not keep going I'm not the point threshold got soul not bit where you buy one the old because the same thing that to play with and it's with you playing with it so that's the place to start but if you don't have any of those little moments %HESITATION on your way home from from this event here's some things just always like I said put raisins eliminates high entertaining and what your coffee still dry and they that sounds a little bit like watching paint dry we just see what we think is worth watching I'm get I am you know I'm in the quad taste it in a positive thirty cups around there's so many things you can do to play with two cups is brilliant the most obvious one is to get to Cup get a spoon top the tea Cup around the room and listen and you will hear something strange I'm using it puts you taste of the table for some types of table because you can write and you learn stuff from it and if you're feeling really ambitious try and push off in such a way that doesn't full but the side down and which is possible so the point of all of this is not this we should all play with toys right we shouldn't be afraid to investigate the physical world for ourselves with the tools around us because we all have access to them it must service because if we want to understand society if you want to be good citizens we need to understand the framework on which everything else must be based so playing with toys is great understanding how to keep a life support systems going is great but fundamentally the thing that we need to change in the way that we talk about physics is that we need to understand the physics isn't out that with which people and strange hieroglyphics for somebody else in a poor slob physics is right here it's for us and we can all play with it thank you very much for more Ted talk at Ted dot com all six
