Like other predominantly black churches across the country Trinity embodies
the black community in its entirety the doctor and the welfare mom the model
student and the former gangbanger. The press has scoured every exit poll for
the latest evidence of racial polarization not just in terms of white and
black but black and brown as well. I am the son of a black man from Kenya and
a white woman from Kansas. A lack of economic opportunity among black men and
the shame and frustration that came from not being able to provide for ones
family contributed to the erosion of black families a problem that welfare
policies for many years may have worsened.
