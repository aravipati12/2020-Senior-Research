Ted talks a recorded live at the Ted conference and produced with WNYC New York public radio this episode features architecture for humanity founder came in some clear winner of the two thousand six Ted price Ted talks are made possible through the support of BMW here's Cameron Sinclair so I'm gonna take you on a journey very quickly to explain the wish I'm gonna have to take you somewhere which many people have been that's around the world when I was about twenty four years old %HESITATION Kate store myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work not only about responding to natural disasters involved in systemic issues we believe that where the resources and expertise SKS innovative sustainable design %HESITATION design can really make a difference in people's lives so this all began when I started my life as an architect or training as an architect and I was always interested in socially responsible design and how you can really make an impact when I went to architecture school it seems that I was a black sheep in the family %HESITATION many architects seem to think that when you design your design a tool and that it's a tool that you try and crave for what is I felt that when you design you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which a designing it so you're not just doing a building for the residents %HESITATION or or for the people gonna use it but for the community as a whole and in nineteen ninety nine %HESITATION we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in Kosovo and I didn't know what I was doing like I say mid twenties %HESITATION and I'm a on the internet generation so we started a website we put a call out the and to my surprise in a couple of months we had hundreds of entries from around the world %HESITATION that led to a number of prototypes being built in really experimenting with some ideas %HESITATION two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub Saharan Africa responding to the HIV aids pandemic that that led to %HESITATION five hundred and fifty entries in fifty three countries %HESITATION we also %HESITATION have designers from around the world to participate %HESITATION and %HESITATION we had an exhibit of works that the follow that %HESITATION two thousand four was the tipping point for us %HESITATION we started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran and bam also following up on I work in Africa %HESITATION working within the United States most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner but go live I live in Bozeman Montana go up to the north plans on the reservations we'll go down to Alabama or Mississippi pre Katrina and I could have shown you places that have far worse condition than many developing countries I've been to so we got involved in and what and in the cities and elsewhere and then also I will go into some more project two thousand five mother nature kicked our **** I think we can pretty much assume that two thousand five was a horrific yeah when it comes to natural disasters and because of the internet and because of %HESITATION connections to blogs and so forth within literally hours of the tsunami we are already raising funds getting involved working with with people on the ground %HESITATION we run from a couple of laptops in the first couple of days I had four thousand emails from people needing help so %HESITATION we began to get involved in projects that and I'll talk about some others and then of course this year we've been responding to Katrina as well as following up on a reconstruction work so this is a brief overview in two thousand four I really couldn't manage the number of people who want to help or the number of requests that I was getting it was all coming into my laptop and cell phone so we decided to embrace an open %HESITATION basically an open source model of business that anyone anywhere in the world could stop a local chapter and they can get involved in local problems because I believe there is no such thing as utopia or problems a local all solutions a local so and that means you know somebody who's based in and Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do so that so what happened is we used to meet up and and all these other kind of internet tools and we ended up having forty trap to starting up thousands of architects and a hundred and four countries in the past seven years this isn't just about non profit what it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on a socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller and we have the opportunity not the responsibility with the opportunity to really get involved in making change so what you don't know is that we've got these thousands of design is working around the world we're connected basically by a website we have a staff of three and and so it shows the power of just a single website another by doing something the fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it we did it and so that's something to be said about many of today so seven years later we've developed so that we've got advocacy instigation implementation we advocate for good design not only through student workshops and lectures in public forums all pads we have a book on humanitarian work but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy we can talk about FEMA but that's another talk %HESITATION instigation developing ideas with communities and NGOs doing open source design competitions %HESITATION referring match making with communities in implementing actually going out there and doing the work because when you invent it's never a reality until it's built so it's really important that if we're designing and and I'm trying to create change we build that change so here's a select number of projects posts about %HESITATION we did an open design competition like I said it led to a whole variety of of ideas and this wasn't about emergency shelter but transitional shelter that would last five to ten years that would be placed next to the the land resident lived in and that they would rebuild their own home this wasn't imposing an architecture on a community this was giving them the tools and and and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow at the way they want to we had from the sublime to the ridiculous but they work to this an inflatable henhouse it was built it works %HESITATION this is a shipping container bell and works on a whole variety of ideas to not only dealt with architectural building but also the issues of governance and the idea of creating community through complex networks so we can gauge not just designers but also you know a whole variety of a technology based professionals are using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes %HESITATION using %HESITATION %HESITATION troll bell construction creating he walls %HESITATION and then something remarkable happened in ninety nine as we went to Africa and %HESITATION originally to look at the housing issue and %HESITATION within three days to realize the problem was not housing it was the the growing pandemic of HIV aids and it wasn't doctors telling us this it was actual villages that we were staying with and so we came up with bright idea that instead of getting people to walk ten fifteen calamitous to see doctors you get the doctors to the people and we started engaging that the medical community and I thought you know we thought we were real bright you know Spock's we've come up with great idea mobile health clinics that can the widely distributed throughout sub Sahara Africa and the community the medical community that said %HESITATION we set this for the last decade we know this we just don't know how to show this so in a way we had take a pre existing needs and shown up solutions and so again we had a whole variety of ideas that came in %HESITATION this one I personally love because the idea the architecture is not just about solutions but about raising awareness this is a commander-in-chief's and you grow and a plot of land and then %HESITATION once and it grows fourteen feet in a month and on the fourth week the doctors come in they mow out an area a tensile structure on the top and when the doctor to finish treating and and and and %HESITATION seeing patients on and villages you cut down the clinic and you eat it it's an eat your own clinic so it's dealing with the fact that %HESITATION if you have aids you also need to have nutrition rates in the idea that the the idea of nutrition is as important as getting anti retroviral south so you know this is serious serious solution this one I love the idea is is not just the clinic at the community center this so this looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community so it can be a self sustaining complete self sustaining project everyone of these projects is sustainable that's not because I'm a tree hugging green person it's because when you live on four dollars a day you living on survival and you have to be sustainable you have to know where your energies coming from you have to know what your resources coming from and you have to keep the main stem so this is this is about getting an economic engine and then at night it turns into a movie theater so it's not an aids clinic it's a it's a community center I needs ideas developed into prototypes and they are eventually built a currently as of this year there are clinics rolling out in Nigeria and Kenya from that we also developed see a temper which was a project the community came to us and said the problem is that the girls don't have education and we're working in an area where young women between the ages of sixteen and twenty four have a fifty percent HIV aids right and that's not because they're promiscuous it's because there's no knowledge and so we decided to look at the idea of sports and create a U. sports center that doubled as an HIV aids outreach center and the coaches of the girls team will also trains doctors so that that would be a very slow way of developing %HESITATION %HESITATION kind of confidence in healthcare and we pick nine finalists and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region and then the community pick that design they said this is our design because it's not only about engaging a community it's about empowering a community about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process I'm but what we know probably most for is dealing with disasters and development and we've been involved in a lot of issues such as %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION the tsunami and also things like hurricane Katrina this is a three hundred and seventy dollars shelter that can be easily assembled this is a community design %HESITATION community designed %HESITATION community center and what that means is we actually live and work with the community and that part of the design process the kids actually get involved in mapping out whether the the the the community center should be and then eventually the community it is actually with through skills training and up building the building with us %HESITATION here is another school %HESITATION this is what the unit you and gave these guys for six months %HESITATION twelve plastic tops %HESITATION this is in August this was the replacement I suppose the last two years when the rain comes down you can't hear a thing and in the summer it's about a hundred and forty degrees inside so we said if the rain coming down let's get fresh water so everyone about schools have rainwater collection systems very low cost %HESITATION plus three classrooms and rainwater collection is five thousand dollars this is raised by hot chocolate sales in %HESITATION out in Atlanta %HESITATION it's built by the parents of the kids the kids are out there on site building the buildings and it opened a couple weeks ago when the six hundred kids and now using the schools so does Austin hits home we've seen we we see the bad stories on CNN and fox and all that but we don't see the good stories here is a community that got together and they said no to wait to waiting they formed a partnership diverse partnership of players to actually map out he's Biloxi to figure out who's getting involved we've had over fifteen hundred volunteers rebuilding rehabbing homes %HESITATION figuring out what FEMA regulations all not waiting for them to dictate to us what how you should rebuild working with residents getting out them out of their homes so they don't get ill designing housing this house is going to go in a couple of weeks this is a rehab home done in four days this is a utility room for %HESITATION woman who's on a on a Walker she seventy years old this is what female gave her six hundred Bucks happened two days ago we put together very quickly a washroom it's built it's running and she just started a business today what she's watching other people's clothes what aid agencies do this there's a problem here but we were not alone there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of architects and designers and inventors around the world that getting involved in humanitarian work and this is just a selection of things that happened in the that were built in the last couple of years from Brazil to India Mexico Alabama China Israel Palestine Vietnam the average age of a designer who's gets involved in this project is thirty two that's how old I am but the future is not going to be the sky scraping cities of New York but this when you look at this you see crisis what I see as many many inventors one billion people live in abject poverty we hear about them all the time full billion live in and growing but fragile economies one is seven live in unplanned settlement if we do nothing about the housing crisis is about to happen in twenty years one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement %HESITATION refugee camp look left look right one of you will be that how do we improve the the living standards of five billion people with ten million solutions so I wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable designed to improve the living conditions for everyone open source architectures the way to go you have a diverse community of participants and we're not just to talking about inventors and designers but we're talking about the funding model I my role is known as a design it's a conduit between the design world in the humanitarian world and what we need is something that replicates me globally because I haven't slept in seven years secondly what will this thing be designers want to respond to issues of of humanitarian crisis but they don't want some company %HESITATION in the west taking their idea and basically profiting from it so creative Commons is developed the developing nations license and what that means the %HESITATION design a can of we the C. attempt a project I showed was the first ever building to have a creative Commons license on it as soon as that is still anyone in Africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free why not allow design is the opportunity to do this but still protecting the rights here we want to have %HESITATION a community where you can upload ideas on those ideas can be tested in an earthquake in flood in all sorts of a steer environments the reason that's important is I don't want to wait for the next Katrina to find out if my house works that's too late we need to do it now so doing that globally and and I won this whole thing to work multi lingual way when you look at the face of an architect most people think a great head white guy I don't see that I see the face of the world so I want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this divine design and development the idea of need space competitions we also want to look at ways of match making inputting funding pong this together and the idea of integrating manufacturers fab labs in every country when I hear about a hundred dollar laptop and it's going to educate every child educate every designer in the world put one in every Cevallos every %HESITATION slum settlement because you know what innovation will happen and I need to know that it's called the leap back we talk about leap frog technologies all right with the world changing and the one thing we've been talking about as I learn more on the ground than I've ever learned here so let's take those ideas adopt them and we can use them these ideas are supposed to have %HESITATION adaptable they're allowed to be they they should have the potential for evolution they should be developed by every nation on the world and an unusual for every nation in the world so it's gonna take a lot of computing power because I want list I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world could plug into the system and be able to not only participate in in developing these designs but utilize the designs also %HESITATION a process of reviewing the designs %HESITATION I want every Arab engineer in the world to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that standing because those guys all the best in the world my mom once said there's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers I'm fed up with talking about making chains you only make it by doing it we've changed FEMA guidelines we've changed public policy we've changed international response based on building things so for me it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation and it's free innovation think of free culture this is free innovation let's do it thank you that was Cameron Sinclair recorded at the Ted conference in Monterey California February two
